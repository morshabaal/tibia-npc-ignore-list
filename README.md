# Tibia Ignore List
This list ("NPCs.txt") can be used to ignore all NPCs in the game.
It currently includes all 1149 NPCs (2024-04-19).

## How to ignore the NPCs
Close your Tibia client and then navigate to your Tibia installation directory.
On Windows, you will find the directory at `%localappdata%\Tibia\packages\Tibia`.
Then navigate to the `conf\clientoptions.json` file and open it using a text editor such as Notepad.
Scroll down to the bottom of the file where you will see `blacklistedNames: []`.
Simply copy all NPC names from this page ("`NPCs.txt`") and paste them inside the brackets `[]`.
Save the file and start the Tibia client.
If you check your ignore list (`Ctrl+I`) you will now see all NPCs added there.

## Disclaimer
This does not include NPCs in houses (hirelings) as they have custom names.
